##Exploratory Data Analysis: Handling Missing Values
This notebook is part of the data preprocessing phase, focusing on handling missing values in the dataset. The notebook includes a variety of strategies to deal with the absence of data, each with its use case depending on the nature of the data and the desired outcome of the analysis.

#Description
Missing data can be a significant issue in data analysis and predictive modeling. The choice of how to handle missing values can affect the conclusions drawn from the data and the performance of machine learning models. This notebook outlines several methods for handling missing values, each with a practical example.

#Methods Implemented
Deleting Columns with Missing Data: Entire columns are dropped from the dataset. This method is straightforward but can lead to a significant loss of information if the dropped columns contain important data for the analysis.

Deleting Rows with Missing Data: Rows with missing values are removed. This method can retain valuable columns but may reduce the dataset size significantly, potentially leading to biased results if the missing data is not randomly distributed.

Filling the Missing Values (Imputation): Missing values are filled with a statistically relevant value, such as the mean or median for numerical data or the mode for categorical data. This approach allows the retention of all data points and attributes.

Forward and Backward Filling (Imputation): Missing values are filled using the next or previous values in the dataset. This method is typically used in time-series data where the chronological order of observations can provide a reasonable approximation for missing data.

Time-Series Forecasting Algorithm: This advanced method involves using forecasting algorithms to estimate missing values based on trends and patterns in the data. However, it is not implemented in this notebook due to the complexity and computational demands.

#Getting Started
To run this notebook:

Ensure that you have Jupyter Notebook installed.
The data file should be in the same directory as the notebook or update the path to the file within the notebook.
